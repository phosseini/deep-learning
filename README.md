# Deep Learning Examples
In this repository, I keep the implementation of different examples of Neural Networks.

## List of jupyter notebooks:
* `pytorch_tensors.ipynb`: Intro to PyTorch's Tensors
* `pytorch_autograd.ipynb`: Intro to PyTorch's `autograd`
* `pytorch_model.ipynb`: Building a sample neural network in PyTorch
* `pytorch_image_classifier.ipynb`: Building an image classifier in PyTorch

:eight_spoked_asterisk: The majority of PyTorch code examples are from the official [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
